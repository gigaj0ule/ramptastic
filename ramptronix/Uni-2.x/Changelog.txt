Changelog

2.3 - > 2.4

-Change from Si output Diodes to SiC Diodes for better recovery characteristics (see, none!)
-Removed Auxilary DC-DC converter
-Removed Solder bridge/solder jumper from 95T to output, since it lowers effective current capability, and has too many turns
-Added output PI filter to auxilary buck converter to help reduce noise
-Changed both buck converter inductors (different part num, smaller, since larger size was unnecessary)
-Changed buck converter IC to BD9G101G, which lacks PFM, and also runs at a higher frequency
-Confirmed output frequency of UCC38083, which runs at 35 kHz (meaning, effective 70 kHz to the transformer) with 470k RT.
-Added warning about TL431 pinout
