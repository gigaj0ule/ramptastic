Changelog

2.32 - > 2.4

-Change from Si output Diodes to SiC Diodes for better recovery characteristics (see, none!)

-Removed Auxilary DC-DC converter.

-Removed "premade" transformer. 

-Added output PI filter to auxilary buck converter to help reduce noise.

-Changed both buck converter inductors (different part num, smaller, since larger size was unnecessary).

-Changed aux rail buck converter IC to BD9G101G, which lacks PFM, and also runs at a higher frequency.

-Changed main logic buck converter to LM5164, which can handle 100V input.

-Confirmed output frequency of UCC38083, which runs at 35 kHz (meaning, effective 70 kHz to the transformer) with 470k RT.

-Added warning about TL431 pinout.

-Added two electrolytics to filtering on aux rail, one on the input/transformer side, and one after the Pi filter before the 5V linear regulator.

-Changed transformer to ETD44 size, re-added ETD34 pinout as well.

-Modified compensation values. R12 is now 4.3k, C17 is now 47nF, R15 is 47k. Optocoupler diode side resistor, R35, is now 470 to increase
available current.

-Removed "Injection" header.

-removed ceramic caps from output (deemed unnecessary)

-Changed main switch types

-Increased operating frequency to reduce output inductor size.

-Added filter after LM5164 output.

-Added 10k ohm resistors in series with gate drive signal inputs

-Changed some 0402 caps to 0603 caps on logic supply rail, for robustness.

-Modified schematic for clarity/layout

TO DO 

Change from one gate drive IC to individual gate drivers per FET.

Change from LM317 to LM2931, for robustness.
